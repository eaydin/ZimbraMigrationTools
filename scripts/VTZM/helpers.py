    Not from where it is called. So if the script lives in /opt/zimbra/ZimbraMigrationTools/scripts and
    you call it from /opt as

    $ python zimbra/ZimbraMigrationTools/scripts/some_script.py <args>

    then the path catched will be /opt/zimbra/ZimbraMigrationTools/scripts

    The script will check if /opt/zimbra/ZimbraMigrationTools/scripts/../<custom_folder> exists, if it does, returns it.
    If the path does not exist, will return the current path, '.', which in such as a case, the path will be relative to
    the caller, not where the script lives. In our example, it will return '/opt/.' as the default path.

    If for some reason this argument was not called from a shell (i.e. called from Python interpreter) or
    the input was piped in such a way, it will still default to '.'

    ----------
